<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>You have finished the puzzles. Now it is time for your reward. But lets rewind for a second, why did you do the puzzles? Was it the pressure of doing them at your birthday, was it because it was fun, was it becuase you knew deep in your heart you would get a present at the end??? </p>
<h2>WHY?</h2>
<p>This puzzle represents life. Endlessly solving puzzles and trails, for what? What is the end goal?</p>
<p>The constant struggle of life is only realeased by the sweer relief of death. What is the point of living in the first place?</p>

<p>But maybe we need to adjust our view. Maybe it isnt about the end goal. Maybe life is about the experiences and the friends we make along the way. Making memories with others is the most rewarding part of life. Back to your present, I think the true present is the experience. The reward for completing the puzzles is the fun your had, not the final reward. Because life is not abou the destination, its about the journey.</p>











<p class="final">Also your present is behind the plants at your front door.</p>
