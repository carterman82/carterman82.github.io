      <h1 class="Elmo">Lecture 1 -  Differential Calculus: Exploring Rates of Change and Tangent Lines</h1>

           <p class="parade">Hello, math enthusiasts! Today, we're going to delve into the fascinating world of differential calculus. Differential calculus is like a powerful microscope that allows us to zoom in on the smallest changes and understand the rates of change of functions. Let's embark on this mathematical journey and explore the enchanting properties of differential calculus!<br><br>
           Differential calculus deals with the concepts of limits, derivatives, and tangent lines. Derivatives help us understand the rate at which a function changes at any given point.<br><br>
           Let's start with the concept of limits. The limit of a function represents the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a particular value. It helps us understand the behavior of a function near a specific point.<br><br>
           The derivative of a function represents the rate at which the function is changing at any given point. It measures the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.<br><br>
           To find the derivative of a function, we use differentiation rules and techniques. The derivative of a function f(x) is denoted as f'(x) or dy/dx, and it represents the rate of change of f(x) with respect to x.<br><br>
           For example, if we have a function f(x) = 3x^2, the derivative f'(x) is found by applying the power rule: multiply the coefficient (3) by the exponent (2) and reduce the exponent by 1. So, f'(x) = 6x.<br><br>
           The derivative allows us to determine the slope of the tangent line to the graph of a function at any point. It helps us analyze motion, optimize functions, and solve various real-world problems.<br><br>
           Now, let's practice finding derivatives. Consider the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1. Can you find the derivative f'(x)? Take your time and give it a try. That's right, f'(x) = 12x^2 - 4x + 5!<br><br>
           Differential calculus is like a powerful microscope that reveals the secrets of rates of change and tangent lines. Keep exploring its properties and applications, and you'll become a master of analyzing functions. Remember, math is full of exciting discoveries. Embrace the challenge, and I'll see you soon for our next math adventure!<br><br>

      <h1 class="Elmo">Lecture 2 -  Integral Calculus: Unlocking Areas and Accumulation</h1>

            <p class="parade">Greetings, math wizards! Today, we're going to unlock the power of integral calculus. Integral calculus is like a magic wand that helps us calculate areas, measure accumulation, and solve various real-world problems. Let's dive into this mathematical journey and explore the enchanting properties of integral calculus!<br><br>
               Integral calculus deals with the concepts of integration, antiderivatives, and finding areas under curves. Integrals allow us to reverse the process of differentiation and determine the accumulated change of a function over an interval.<br><br>
               To find the integral of a function, we use integration rules and techniques. The integral of a function f(x) is denoted as ∫f(x)dx and represents the antiderivative of f(x).<br><br>
               For example, if we have a function f(x) = 3x^2, the integral ∫f(x)dx is found by applying the power rule in reverse: increase the exponent by 1 and divide by the new exponent. So, ∫f(x)dx = x^3 + C, where C represents the constant of integration.<br><br>
               Integrals allow us to calculate the area under a curve. The definite integral ∫[a,b]f(x)dx represents the area between the curve of f(x) and the x-axis from x = a to x = b. It helps us solve problems involving areas, volumes, and accumulated quantities.<br><br>
               Now, let's practice finding integrals and calculating areas. Consider the function f(x) = 2x + 3. Can you find the integral ∫f(x)dx and calculate the area under the curve from x = 1 to x = 5? Take your time and give it a try. That's right, ∫f(x)dx = x^2 + 3x + C, and the area under the curve is 46 square units!<br><br>
               Integral calculus is like a magical wand that unlocks the secrets of areas and accumulation. Keep exploring its properties and applications, and you'll become a master of solving real-world problems. Remember, math is full of exciting discoveries.

      <h1 class="Elmo">Lecture 3 - Vectors and Vector Calculus: Navigating in Three-Dimensional Space</h1>

               <p class="parade">Welcome, math explorers! Today, we're going to navigate the captivating world of vectors and vector calculus. Vectors are like arrows that help us understand and manipulate quantities with both magnitude and direction. Let's dive into this mathematical journey and explore the enchanting properties of vectors!<br><br>
                  A vector is a mathematical object that represents both magnitude and direction. Vectors are commonly used to describe physical quantities like displacement, velocity, and force.<br><br>
                  In three-dimensional space, a vector is typically represented by an ordered triple (a, b, c), where a, b, and c are the components of the vector along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.<br><br>
                  We can perform operations on vectors, such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot product. These operations help us manipulate vectors and analyze their properties.<br><br>
                  For example, vector addition involves adding corresponding components of two vectors. If we have vectors u = (1, 2, 3) and v = (4, 5, 6), the sum u + v would be (1+4, 2+5, 3+6) = (5, 7, 9).<br><br>
                  Vector calculus extends the concepts of calculus to vectors. It involves differentiation and integration of vector functions, as well as the calculation of vector fields, line integrals, and surface integrals.<br><br>
                  Now, let's practice working with vectors. Consider the vectors u = (2, -1, 3) and v = (1, 4, -2). Can you determine the dot product of u and v? Take your time and give it a try. That's right, the dot product u · v is 2*1 + (-1)4 + 3(-2) = -3!<br><br>
                  Vectors and vector calculus allow us to navigate and analyze quantities in three-dimensional space. Keep exploring their properties and applications, and you'll become a master of spatial journeys. Remember, math is full of exciting discoveries.
