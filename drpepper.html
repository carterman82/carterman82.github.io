<p>Dr Pepper is my favorite drink. My Grandpa called it the Nectar of the Gods. At his Funeral in 2020 (he died of heart attack literally a week before covid hit and in that same week my brother had appendicidis) We had literally 1000 small Dr Pepper cans. In that whole funeral I drank 126. Dr Pepper sure is good man. Also I dont take back what I said about Diet Coke</p>
